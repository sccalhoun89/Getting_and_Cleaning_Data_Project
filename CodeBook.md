#Getting and Cleaning Data Project Code Book

This data was taken from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 (www.smartlab.ws)

##Files

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

##Descriptions

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

##Notes: 

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.

##Data Labels

Labels are assigned to the appropriate tidy data set columns based on the following:

- t -> Time
- Acc -> Accelerometer
- Gyro -> Gyroscope
- Mag -> Magnitude
- f and freq -> Frequency
- mean -> Mean
- std -> STD (Abbreviation for Standard Deviation)
- angle -> Angle
- gravity -> Gravity
